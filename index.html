    <a href="/niche-post-ideas.html"><h2 class="text-center">How I get niche blog post and website ideas from Amazon</h2></a>

    <p>I'm usually quite stingy with spending on online tools. Mostly because they usually require monthly subscriptions, which I hate. I'm the type of person to buy a service and forget about it, only to find out in my credit card statement that I've been paying for it for the past few months. There is one exception though: <a href="https://www.junglescout.com">Jungle Scout</a>. I absolutely love this tool. I bought it for one month and then cancel it to do some research on a product, but I have since reactived that subscription many times.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Today, I am going to show you how I use it to find new blog posts and even niche websites. The rationale is simple: If people are looking for a product on amazon, they must also be looking for it on google and other platforms. Additionally, it ensures that when I scale the website, I can position my own products or that my affiliate links will convert well.</p>

    <a href="/hosting-options.html"><h2 class="text-center">Hosting options: How I deploy and host my websites</h2></a>

    <p>Hosting can be a pain in the ass. Its incredible to me how difficult it still is to host a website online. Most people have no knowledge of how "the internet" actually works- I.e- what dns addresses are, what servers are, and how each server can have different operating systems etc. They just know that once they write a certain URL and press enter, their browser window will display the website they are looking for.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In a time when the barrier between consumer and producer is breaking down, I would've expect that there would be one or more tools that would be ubiquitous to deploying and hosting websites, kind of like how wordpress is the tool for blogging. But, as far as I can tell, there are no clear winners in this space, perhaps also due to the variety of different programming languages and frameworks that people used.</p>

    <a href="/monetisation-table.html"><h2 class="text-center">Monetization breakdown: A comprehensive list of online business monetization data.</h2></a>

      <p>For the past year or so, I've been keeping a eye out for data on revenue, impressions, n. of users, etc of all online businesses I can find and storing them on an excel spreadsheet. Today, I have decided to make this information public and share it on this page.</p>

  <h1 class="text-center">How I get niche blog post and website ideas from Amazon</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I'm usually quite stingy with spending on online tools. Mostly because they usually require monthly subscriptions, which I hate. I'm the type of person to buy a service and forget about it, only to find out in my credit card statement that I've been paying for it for the past few months. There is one exception though: <a href="https://www.junglescout.com">Jungle Scout</a>. I absolutely love this tool. I bought it for one month and then cancelled it to do some research on a product, but I have since reactived that subscription many times.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Today, I am going to show you how I use it to find new blog posts and even niche websites. The rationale is simple: If people are looking for a product on amazon, they must also be looking for it on google and other platforms. Additionally, it ensures that when I scale the website, I can sell my own products or post affiliate links that convert well, enabling me to improve revenues and profits.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I got this idea from an episode of the <a href="http://www.nichepursuits.com/podcast-126-dave-chesson-used-seo-traffic-launch-kindle-books-software-business/">niche pursuit podcast with Dave Chesson</a> of <a href="http://kindlepreneur.com">kindlepreneur</a>. He has a strategy that I love and he explains it very well: He looks at his websites as real estate in the game monopoly. When they start out, they are pretty basic or empty and you don't get paid much when somebody stops there. However, once you start building hotels, you really start to see the money coming in. This strategy makes perfect sense to me: Build a bunch of websites and as soon as one starts ranking and pulling in traffic, move it up the business model lader: Adsense - Amazon Affiliate - Selling your own product on Amazon. Your lader can be different, but the point is that you only really start working on improving the margins when the traffic justifies it. I did a very bad drawing using MS Paint of my pyramid (I swear this isn't a scheme) below: </p>
  <img src="monetisation-pyramid.png" alt="" class="center-block" style="width: 30%;">
  <p>The numbers I chose are a bit random, specially the 50K mark to start your own product, but assuming that 1% of your website visitors end up purchasing your product, that translates into 500 units sold per month and 6,000 per year, which usually already justifies the investment.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Ok, I got a bit side-tracked there, but this strategy got me thinking: If the ultimate goal is to sell on amazon, why not start on a niche that I know will convert well on amazon? That way, I kill two birds with one stone: I'm not starting an amazon dependent business and my niche site revenue isn't limited to adsense's ridiculous payouts. It's too early to declare this strategy a clear winner, specially since I think I might struggle to find niches which are big enough to reach over 50,000 visits a month, but this first effort has been promising. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Ok, so here's how I do it:</p>
  <h3 class="text-center">Step 1- Go to Jungle Scout's "Niche Hunter" Tool</h3>
  <br>
  <h3 class="text-center">Step 2- Choose all categories or a specific category</h3>
  <p>If you already have websites/business in a certain niche, you might want to focus on that category. If you want to cast a wider net, choose all categories</p>
  <br>
  <h3 class="text-center">Step 3- Choose an average price of at least 25$, competition between 30 and 70 and opportunity score of at least 50.</h3>
  <p>These are my personal filters, but feel free to use your own numbers. I want medium competition so that a) I know the product is popular and thus people will be searching outside of amazon for it too and b) It is not so high that I won't be able to generate sales on amazon by itself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="JS_Print.png" alt="Jungle Scout Print Screen" style="width: 80%" class="center-block">
    <br>
  <p>And boom, there you have it. A list of products to build your site around. Now what you can do is look for clusters of products in the same theme or category and build a branded website around that. As I said, it's far too early to call this a sucess but I have identified a couple of niches and am currently building content around them. I will keep you updated as to how they work out.</p>
